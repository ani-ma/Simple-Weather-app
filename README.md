## Simple-Weather-app
This is a simple weather app made using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
There is not much to it, just enter a city name and it shows the weather, humidity, wind speed...
I've made this project to test different stuff and try new things.

### Run locally
- Load the project
- Add your [API key](https://openweathermap.org/current) 
- Open with live server
- That's it!
